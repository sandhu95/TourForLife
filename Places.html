					A public market had been held on the north building site since 1803. Several buildings housed the market, the most recent built in 1968.
					The South building dates to 1845, has been rebuilt twice, and still incorporates a section of its original building that was used as Toronto
					City Hall from 1845. St. Lawrence Hall is an event and office building on King at Jarvis, built in 1850<br>

				<H1>CITY HALL</H1>
				<p>	<img id="LEFT" src="photoes\places\ciy hall toronto\city hall3.jpg" width="100%" alt="CITY HALL">
					By convention, until the mid 19th-century, a single large open chamber (or 'hall') formed an integral part of the building housing the 
					council. The hall may be used for council meetings and other significant events. This large chamber, the "town hall" (and its later 
					variant "city hall") has become synonymous with the whole building, and with the administrative body housed in it. The terms "council 
					chambers", "municipal building" or variants may be used locally in preference to "town hall" if no such large hall is present within the
					building. The local government may endeavor to use the town hall building to promote and enhance the quality of life of the community. 
					In many cases, "town halls" serve not only as buildings for government functions, but also have facilities for various civic and cultural 
					activities. These may include art shows, stage performances, exhibits and festivals. Modern town halls or "civic centres" are often 
					designed with a great variety and flexibility of purpose in mind.<br>
